*Zettel Social* is a service that allows an individual to interact with
others. In its initial incarnation it just publishes static HTML content,
but this will change. In the future, it might process content created by a
[Zettelstore](https://zettelstore.de). It might automatically produce several
RSS stream, handle ActivityPub requests, manage IndieWeb interactions, and so
on.

Zettel Social is at first the personal interaction platform of Detlef Stern. If
you find it useful, be happy about it.
